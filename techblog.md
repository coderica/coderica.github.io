This week you've learned a bit about the command line and gotten more familiar with Git and GitHub. Now it's your turn to write a blog to introduce these concepts to other beginners. Be sure to think about:

- What are the benefits of version control?
- How does git help you keep track of changes?
- Why use GitHub to store your code?
- any research you found that is worthy of sharing?
-anything you wish you had known before starting this week?
-anything you learned that made the process much quicker/easier?

As a newly christened member of the developer community, my first inclination is to insist that what I have to say is not relevant to the coding community. However, after giving this some thought, I realize that this is not only utterly false, but <i>backwards</i>. Starting from scratch not only means that I have a clean slate for learning, but an unbiased opinion on process, and a thirst for knowledge. By creating the habit of sharing my journey and my findings with others, I am bound to influence the community through a passion for not only good code, but <b><i>creative code</i></b>. So, in lieu of this understanding, I would like to ask you to do three things. 

Firstly, please for the love of git don't look at the source code of this site. I will be more than happy to teach you how to do anything you see on this page (tweet/email/pm me!), but I'm warning you, code flow looks like a 16 year old boy's bedroom after a week of being home alone. I'm not kidding, its nasty in there. Just... don't.

Second, I would encourage you not to take my word for anything. Research, as I have already discovered, is a developer's best friend. There are so many people in this community who want to share their knowledge, and if you aren't exploiting this amazing opportunity to <i>learn more</i>, you aren't doing it right.

And third, whatever it is, enjoy it! I have been stuck doing something I don't love, and it is a complete was of time, energy, and ethos. Movement is life, and if you aren't moving forwards, you are stagnant... like the Nile, which harbors all sorts nasty. You get it. No? Look it up.

So to end, I leave you with this poem, a glance into the flow of a passionate developer...

Pour up (code), head shot (code)
Sit down (code), stand up (code)
Pass out (code), wake up (code)
Faded (code), faded (code)
