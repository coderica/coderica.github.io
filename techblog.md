This week you've learned a bit about the command line and gotten more familiar with Git and GitHub. Now it's your turn to write a blog to introduce these concepts to other beginners. Be sure to think about:

- What are the benefits of version control?
- How does git help you keep track of changes?
- Why use GitHub to store your code?
- any research you found that is worthy of sharing?
- anything you wish you had known before starting this week?
- anything you learned that made the process much quicker/easier?


Gitting started is not easy





undo a commit
push and pull <i>different</i> versions
automated login
navigating files

In coding, the only thing which holds us back from creating is our own ignorance, so learn as much as you can, most especially regarding efficiency. The goal of every good developer is to remove as much redundancy as possible so that they can focus on producing. Spend a couple of weeks committed to your work flow. Figure out which text editor is best for you (I really using sublime) and then take the time to learn how to customize it with plugins and settings and themes. Read a bajillion "Top 10 tips on //ThingofInterest//", "How to //DoAThing//" and "Why I switched to //AnotherThing//" articles. AUTOMATE EVERYTHING. Spend some hours browsing <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com/" rel="external">Skillcrush</a> or some other beautiful webdev blogsite with succinct articles. Open an account with <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/" rel="external">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/" rel="external">Github</a> and familiarize yourself with online developer etiquette. Get annoyingly good at Git and your CLI (command line interface). Did I just throw a bunch of words at you which you aren't familiar with? If you learn nothing else from my post, at least take this away: Google is absolutely the <i><b>MOST</b></i> powerful tool we have access to online. Google is the ultimate enabler, and puts <i>all of the knowledge in the history of the world</i> in your hands. Don't waste it.

If you are absolutely at a loss of where to start, I have two resources I will point you to which I used to dive in. The first is this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course" rel="external">Udemy</a> course by Rob Percival. Not only is it structured in such a way that a third grader could follow his tutorials, he covers nearly all of the most popular languages, and is incredibly responsive to his students. It doesn't hurt that he is a marketing <i>genius</i> (seriously, take notes) and his book on making money while learning to code is definitely worth the read. It is paid, but look for a promo code online. He almost always has some outlandish discount. My second suggestion, which is much more radical, would be to consider a developer bootcamp.
