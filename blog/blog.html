					Ruby gives us two ways to deal with organizing data structures; arrays and hashes. Both are very similar and easily confused. What you can do with arrays, you can also often do with hashes, and visa versa. They share many of the same methods, and are even born in the same fashion...

					Did you ever find yourself suited up to jump in the pool, excitement pushing you to the edge, when all the sudden excitement turns to dread as your big toe hits the cold water and you are filled with regret. "This was a terrible idea," you think.

					When you first begin working with CSS, a lot of people suggest that getting the code to function is more important than HOW you get it function. To some degree, I can see how this would serve as a sort of confidence boost to encourage you to keep working with plans of going back later to revise old code. The problem is you probably never will.

					As you get into developing, especially at the start, you will begin to realize that you cannot entirely avoid working with design. Even if you aspire to be entirely back end, you will have to work with a designer to accomplish a task. The more you understand this aspect of your project, the more clear your objectives will be, especially within your code.

					Memorizing commands is a huge part of learning to code. It helps that, for the most part, the language is very logical. Github and git and terminal and the general language of developing is incredibly intuitive. This was all created by people who wanted to make the process of creation <i>as simple as possible</i>. It's quite beautiful, really.

					In coding, the only thing which holds us back from creating is our own ignorance, so learn as much as you can, most especially regarding efficiency. The goal of every good developer is to remove as much redundancy as possible so that they can focus on producing. Spend a couple of weeks committed to your work flow.
