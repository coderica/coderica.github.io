- Explain the symptoms and consequences of stereotype threat
- Create strategies for combating stereotype threat
Consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it. If you have, how did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically? If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to? If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?
