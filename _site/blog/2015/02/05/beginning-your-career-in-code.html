  <h3>Beginning Your Career In Code</h3>

In coding, the only thing which holds us back from creating is our own ignorance, so learn as much as you can, most especially regarding efficiency. The goal of every good developer is to remove as much redundancy as possible so that they can focus on producing. Spend a couple of weeks committed to your work flow. Figure out which text editor is best for you (I really using sublime) and then take the time to learn how to customize it with plugins and settings and themes. Read a bajillion "Top 10 tips on //ThingofInterest//", "How to //DoAThing//" and "Why I switched to //AnotherThing//" articles. AUTOMATE EVERYTHING. Spend some hours browsing <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com/" rel="external">Skillcrush</a> or some other beautiful webdev blogsite with succinct articles. Open an account with <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/" rel="external">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/" rel="external">Github</a> and familiarize yourself with online developer etiquette. Get annoyingly good at Git and your CLI (command line interface). Did I just throw a bunch of words at you which you aren't familiar with? If you learn nothing else from my post, at least take this away: Google is absolutely the <i><b>MOST</b></i> powerful tool we have access to online. Google is the ultimate enabler, and puts <i>all of the knowledge in the history of the world</i> in your hands. Don't waste it.
</p>
<p>
If you are absolutely at a loss of where to start, I have two suggestions I will point you to, which I personally used to dive in. The first is this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course" rel="external">Udemy</a> course by Rob Percival. Not only is it structured in such a way that a third grader could follow his tutorials, he covers nearly all of the most popular languages, and is incredibly responsive to his students. It doesn't hurt that he is a marketing <i>genius</i> (seriously, take notes) and his book on making money while learning to code is definitely worth the read. It is paid, but look for a promo code online. He almost always has some outlandish discount.
</p>
<p>
My second suggestion, which is much more radical, would be to consider a developer bootcamp. There are literally hundreds to choose from, catering to all different audiences at all different skill levels with all different price points. You are bound to find something which suits your needs. The big names are <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com" rel="external">Hack Reactor</a>, <a href="https://www.appacademy.io" rel="external">App Academy</a>, and of course, the one I chose to attend (which also happens to be the original developer bootcamp) <a href="https://www.devbootcamp.com" rel="external">Dev Bootcamp</a> (more on why I chose DBC later). I suggest you start <a href="http://www.skilledup.com/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-coding-bootcamps-the-exhaustive-list/" rel="external">here</a>, a very long list detailing all of the different available bootcamps, what they each teach and cost.
</p>
<p>
Below I have detailed a short list of more resources to help inspire your own research.
</p>
<p>
- This is an amazing <a href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2014/09/04/learn-to-code/" rel="external">infographic</a> detailing each major language, what you can achieve with it, and its relative job market demographics.
</p>
<p>
- Here is a beautifully written inspirational article about learning to code written by the talented young professional, <a href="https://medium.com/@cecilycarver/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329" rel="external">Cecily Carver</a>.
</p>
<p>
- Last, I love this <a href="http://www.quora.com/Any-bootcamps-that-give-scholarships-to-women-besides-Dev" rel="external">Quora thread</a> about developer bootcamp scholarships for women (sorry guys).

Before I leave you to your own devices, I offer you an expression which has completely changed my life, spoken by a man who lived by his own advice, "Stay hungry...Stay foolish."
