<p>
As a newly christened member of the developer community, my first inclination is to insist that what I have to say is not relevant to the coding community. However, after giving this some thought, I realize that this is not only utterly false, but <i>backwards</i>. Starting from scratch not only means that I have a clean slate for learning, but an unbiased opinion on process, and a thirst for knowledge. By creating the habit of sharing my journey and my findings with others, I am bound to influence the community through a passion for not only good code, but <b><i>creative code</i></b>. So, in lieu of this understanding, I would like to ask you to do three things...
</p><p>
First, I would encourage you not to take my word for anything. Research, as I have already discovered, is a developer's best friend. There are so many people in this community who want to share their knowledge, and if you aren't exploiting this amazing opportunity to <i>learn more</i>, you aren't doing it right.
</p><p>
Second, whatever it is, enjoy it! I have been stuck doing something I don't love, and it is a complete was of time, energy, and ethos. Movement is life, and if you aren't moving forwards, you are stagnant... like the Nile, which harbors all sorts nasty. You get it. No? Look it up. So to end, I leave you with this poem, a glance into the flow of a passionate developer...

Pour up (code), head shot (code)<br>
Sit down (code), stand up (code)<br>
Pass out (code), wake up (code)<br>
Faded (code), faded (code)
