	  <b>Hi, I'm Erica.</b>
	<br>
		I am a graphic designer and full stack developer. I strongly believe that creating with respect to both aesthetic and function in equal measure are central to the success of creative work. Things I love: travel, my husband, my dog, learning, and using my hands to create beautiful and meaningful things.
