<!-- Now that you've used arrays and hashes a bit, it is your chance to fully formalize that learning. Do a bit more research. Create examples of why you would use one over the other. Imagine presenting these structures to people who know nothing about programming. Describe and compare arrays and hashes. Be sure to include examples! Use the <code></code> tag to include snippets for Ruby in html so it's beautifully formatted!
