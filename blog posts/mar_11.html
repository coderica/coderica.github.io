Option 1: Variable Scope
What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different?

Option 2: Classes vs Modules
Describe and explain the purposes of classes and modules. How are they similar? How do they compare?

Option 3: Inheritance vs Composition
What is Ruby inheritance? What is composition? Which have you used this week? Create your own examples to explain how to use each. See the [BONUS challenges](10-BONUS-challenges) for another challenge that addresses these concepts.
