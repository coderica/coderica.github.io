# U2.W5: Technical Blog Entry

- Explain when, why, and how to use classes
- Explain how data structures and classes can model a real-world object

Pick something (like a real-world object) you would like to model. Create an example class and teach others when to use instance variables, instance methods, etc. for that object. Write about the class you designed. This is part of your portfolio that will help set you apart to employers when you graduate, so have fun and show your enthusiasm!
